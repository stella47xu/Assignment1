musharraf s last act  
general musharraf appeared on the national scene on october 0  0  when he ousted an elected government and announced an ambitious  nation building  project. 
many pakistanis  disillusioned with pakistan s political class  remained mute  thinking that he might deliver. 
the september 0  0  terrorist attacks on america brought musharraf into the international limelight as he agreed to ditch the taliban and support the united states led war on terror. 
musharraf clamped down on some religious militants operating inside pakistan and also on those fighting indian forces in kashmir. 
as a result  pakistan was rewarded with american financial assistance and arms. 
in furtherance of his re alignment  musharraf sent the pakistani army into the tribal areas bordering afghanistan for the first time since pakistan s independence. 
operations there against taliban and al qaeda forces brought mixed results. 
although the us viewed musharraf as an agent of change  he has never achieved domestic political legitimacy  and his policies were seen as rife with contradictions. 
for example  he made alliances with islamist political forces  who in 0 voted for constitutional changes legitimizing his position and actions . 
at the same time  he sidelined moderate  mainstream political leaders while claiming that he stood for  enlightened moderation.  
a series of ill planned military operations in the tribal areas further complicated the situation in the volatile border region. 
last march  musharraf took his boldest step  removing the chief justice of the supreme court  iftikhar chaudhry. 
to the surprise of many  the country s legal community organized a nation wide movement to restore the chief justice to his post. 
hundreds of thousands of ordinary people demanded the rule of law and the supremacy of the constitution  emboldening the judiciary and changing the country s political dynamic. 
in a historic ruling that musharraf had little choice but to accept  the supreme court itself reinstated the chief justice in july. 
subsequently  the energized judiciary continued ruling against government decisions  embarrassing the government    especially its intelligence agencies. 
government officials were held accountable for actions that were usually beyond the reach of the law  ranging from brutal beatings of journalists  to illegal confinement for  national security.  
musharraf and his political allies tried to adjust to this new reality  but their patience ran out when the supreme court took up petitions against musharraf s decision to run for president. 
according to the constitution  originally promulgated in 0 by an elected parliament   a serving military official cannot run for an elected office. 
musharraf was not ready to give up his military post  but also wanted to be a civilian president. 
while he announced that he would leave his military position  if  he was elected president  his track record of reneging on his promises haunted the judiciary. 
the proceedings of the court over the last few weeks made musharraf jittery. 
the decision of the 0 member bench might easily have gone against him. 
legally cornered  musharraf has now decided to abandon constitutionality  removing the leading judges of the supreme court and provincial high courts and putting curbs on the media. 
lawyers  human rights activists  and political leaders have since been arrested. 
there is widespread public resentment in response to these moves. 
rather than taking responsibility for the deteriorating security situation  as evidenced by regular suicide bomb attacks  and the increasing talibanization of the tribal areas  musharraf has tried to blame the judiciary and media. 
to be sure  in some cases  judicial activism was obvious  though within the realm of constitutional law   and the media also made mistakes  but by no stretch of the imagination can these be linked to religious extremism or support for militancy. 
it is unlikely that musharraf s latest gambit will succeed  as his popular support is at its lowest ebb. 
pakistan s armed forces    repeated targets of suicide bombers    have become demoralized. 
it is difficult to imagine them standing with musharraf should civil conflict erupt. 
nor can a weak  embattled  and disoriented musharraf be expected to fight islamic militancy effectively or bring political stability to pakistan. 
opposition political parties are drawing closer together  and former prime minister benazir bhutto  despite progress in her power sharing negotiations with musharraf  has strongly condemned his actions. 
human rights bodies  media associations  and lawyers  organizations are expected to defy the emergency  which will pit them against the security forces. 
terrorists may also benefit by attacking a preoccupied army and political forces aligned with musharraf. 
in the event of sustained protests and potential violence  top military commanders may decide to send musharraf home    a decision that would not be unprecedented in pakistan s chronically turbulent history. 
the making of a murder in pakistan 
instead  bhutto had to pay with her life for courageously challenging extremists of all stripes    from al qaeda and taliban to the country s religious political parties and military hardliners. 
as heir to zulfikar ali bhutto  the legendary democratic leader who was hanged by general muhammad zia ul haq s government in 0  benazir emerged as a symbol of resistance at a young age    but languished in jails and exile in the 0 s. 
z. a. bhutto s legacy was empowerment of the impoverished and defense of ordinary people s rights amid feudalistic politics and military rule. 
rather than bowing to the military junta  he embraced the gallows. 
hours before his hanging  benazir was allowed to see her father for the last time  writing in her autobiography   i told him on my oath in his death cell  i would carry on his work.  
she largely lived up to the promise. 
her first stint as prime minister  0 0  was brief and disorganized. 
lt. gen. hamid gul  the former inter services intelligence  isi  chief  confirmed that he sponsored an alliance of right wing political parties to stop her from getting a parliamentary majority. 
information about pakistan s nuclear program and isi operations in afghanistan were out of her domain. 
her second term in office  0 0  was longer and better  but her government again fell early  owing to charges of mismanagement and corruption. 
in reality  machinations by the intelligence agencies also played a part. 
the military had developed an entrenched distrust of her  given her position as a popularly supported pro western leader who wanted peace with india. 
after almost a decade in self imposed exile  bhutoo s return to pakistan in october gave her a fresh political start. 
pakistan had changed  as military dictatorship and religious extremism in the north played havoc with the fabric of society. 
a tentative arrangement with musharraf  together with western support    particularly from the united kingdom and the united states    eased her return  which hundreds of thousands of people welcomed  though terrorists greeted her with a string of suicide bombings. 
bhutto s contacts with mushararf s military government drew criticism  but she remained adamant that a return to democracy was possible only through a transition in which musharraf would give up his military post  become a civilian head of state  and conduct free and fair elections. 
to the dismay of some democratic forces  bhutto stayed the course even after musharraf imposed emergency rule on november 0 and removed the country s top judges to ensure his re election. 
indeed  she even persuaded other important political leaders to participate in the planned january 0 election  which she viewed as an opportunity to challenge religious extremist forces in the public square. 
she seized that opportunity by bravely traveling throughout the country  despite serious threats to her life  arguing for a democratic and pluralistic pakistan. 
one can understand why religious extremists like al qaeda and taliban would target her  and the government claims that it is impossible to defend against a suicide attack. 
but bhutto was reportedly killed by a sharp shooter before the terrorist blew himself up. 
so  in the eyes of pakistan s people  and especially of bhutto s supporters  the intelligence services  either alone or in collaboration with extremists  finally decided to eliminate her. 
whether or not the government was involved  the fact remains that pakistan has lost a desperately needed leader. 
with pakistan s future in the balance  the west s help and support will be crucial  but that means recognizing that musharraf is not the only leader who can resolve pakistan s myriad problems and manage the war on terror. 
on the contrary  by nurturing the current environment of instability and uncertainty  musharraf himself must be regarded as one of pakistan s biggest problems. 
exorcising musharraf s ghost 
unlike iraq and afghanistan  democracy is not new to this 0 year old state  but ethnic cleavages  weak institutions  and religious extremism in the north are perennially destabilizing. 
and  while the new government settles in and establishes its priorities  the west  especially the united states  must reassess the impact of its past dealings with pakistan. 
pakistan s new prime minister  yousaf gilani  is a seasoned politician and  more importantly  has sufi family roots  which is a good omen because of the sufi tradition of tolerance. 
gilani unequivocally declared in his inaugural address that fighting terrorism is a top priority  and his first decision was to release from house arrest judges deposed by musharraf. 
the respite from the horrendous spate of suicide bombings since the new government assumed power is similarly heartening. 
but the honeymoon period is coming to an end. 
already  in gilani s hometown of multan  rioters attacked government offices and banks to protest electricity disruptions. 
a couple of well known opposition politicians  a chief minister and a federal cabinet minister of the previous pro musharraf government  were publicly thrashed  raising doubts about government control over law and order in the country. 
so far  musharraf has accepted his diminishing stature quietly    though he has few other options. 
the new political leadership  both inside and outside the parliament  has been carefully avoiding a head on collision with the president. 
interestingly  in the midst of the political transition  musharraf embarked on a week long visit to china to lobby for construction of an oil and gas pipeline between china and the persian gulf that would be routed through pakistan. 
the deeper question raised by this proposal is whether musharraf meant to convey a message to the us that pakistan s priorities were shifting. 
the revival of democratic politics in pakistan will undoubtedly effect pakistan us relations. 
pakistan s military links with america appear to remain on a sound footing  so the strategic alliance with the us is likely to continue  perhaps with some nuanced differences over how to fight the  war on terror.  
but pakistani politicians are bound to be influenced by domestic public opinion  which is generally critical of us policies. 
nevertheless  long term us interests in the region will be better served if pakistan s democratic forces successfully establish themselves. 
a proposal in the us senate to increase development and education aid to pakistan could help in winning the hearts and minds. 
meanwhile  president george w. bush has said that  if another september 0 style attack is being planned  it probably is being plotted in pakistan and not afghanistan.  
whether this american intelligence assessment is based on credible information is unknown. 
american election year politics may also be behind this assertion. 
but it is significant that bush decided to voice this view during pakistan s political transition. 
pakistan must take this view seriously  regardless of bush s motivations. 
the new government should quickly devise a policy to deal with terrorism. 
recent months have seen dozens of suicide bombings and other terrorist activities    the price of pakistan s own past blunders  as well as those of the west. 
afghanistan is a prime example  as is the failure to settle the kashmir imbroglio with india. 
both failures have strengthened domestic terrorist groups. 
pakistan s government appears to be preparing to talk to some of the extremists in the tribal areas  introduce political reforms  and redouble development efforts. 
but reference to  talks  makes the west uncomfortable. 
american officials have likened this strategy to negotiating with terrorists  and point to a previous round of negotiations that did nothing to stop violence in the tribal areas. 
but the new leadership wants to distinguish between al qaeda terrorists and religious conservatives and disillusioned pashtun youth within pakistan. 
after all  the victory of the secular awami national party  anp  in pakistan s north west frontier province is a strong indication that people there have rejected religious political forces and violence. 
this window of opportunity can be expanded through dialogue and reconciliation with those who are ready to disavow extremism and militancy. 
the new pakistani government needs to explain this to the west in order to keep its support. 
the us  meanwhile  should end direct military strikes in the area  even if these are conducted with the knowledge and cooperation of pakistan s military. 
force has never worked with the pashtun tribes  and there is no evidence that this has changed. 
there are real signs that the new government is considered a credible partner in the tribal areas.
